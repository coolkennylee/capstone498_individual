As the global vaccination campaign continues, the world is getting closer to being 


In this tutorial, we will help fellow students and colleagues learn how to build and deploy a route optimization model on R shinyapps. 


## Steps we will cover in this tutorial

(1) Getting started with Shinyapps

(2) Understanding linear programming and 

(3) How to source/create datasets 

(4) Training, evaluating and exporting the model

(5) Building the application

(6) Deploying the application

(7) Implementing DevOps to implement automated, seamless CI/CD process
